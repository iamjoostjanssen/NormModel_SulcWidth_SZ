Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia (Guil Gallego et al. 2024).

We created a docker that includes the [PCN-toolkit](https://pcntoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_MorphoSim_SZ/blob/main/Docker_and_ReferenceModelling.txt). A list of study IDs from included subjects and their sulcal width values for 106 sulci can be found here. The nomenclature for the sulcal atlas can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ/blob/main/nomenclature_translation_rotated.pdf). The centile and Quantile-Quantile plots for all sulci can be found here and here, respectively. The code for calculating the sulcal width similarity index (as in [Janssen et al. 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7965061/)) can be found [here](https://github.com/iamjoostjanssen/NormModel_SulcWidth_SZ/blob/main/sulcalwidth_similarity_index.R).
