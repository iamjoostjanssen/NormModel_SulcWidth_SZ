Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia

This repository contains information pertaining to the study Normative Modelling of Sulcal Width in Health and Schizophrenia (Janssen et al. 2024).

We created a docker that includes the PCN-toolkit and added extra automated features for model evaluation and visualization. Instructions for installing and running the docker for normative modelling can be found here. A list of study IDs from included subjects and their sulcal width values for 106 sulci can be found here. The centile and Quantile-Quantile plots for all sulci can be found here and here, respectively.
